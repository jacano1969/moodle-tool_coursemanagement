Course and category management tool

This tool has been created to replace the course and category management pages within Moodle.
Its focus is to separate out the management tasks and simplfy them through both a better interface and JavaScript enhancements such as AJAX loading and drag and drop functionality.

To install this tool:
1. Download the tool from github: https://github.com/samhemelryk/moodle-tool_coursemanagement/zipball/master
2. Unzip the tool and move it to ./admin/tool/coursemanagement
3. Check that you have ./admin/tool/coursemanagement/index.php (if you don't things are in the wrong place)
4. Visit your site and log in as an admin to trigger the installation
5. In the settings navigation browse to Site Administration > Courses > Course and category management

Please note this tool is in an early stage of development and is just a prototype.
To ensure better security only users with the moodle/site:config may use it until proper security checks have been implemented.
